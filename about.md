## Gabriel Clermont

### Publisher
Fresh from a four year stint in China, pointing cameras at everything from Tibetan yak farmers to DJs, I’ve returned to NYC where I’m pursuing a master’s in everything that’s media. A filmmaker, programmer and writer, I can mostly be found loudly talking shit in the few remaining dive bars in lower Manhattan.

## Cecilia Mezulic

###Editorial Director

I came from Europe to America a while ago, and have been living between Mexico and New York for the last 6 years. I started studying my MFA at Parsons, taking photos and experimenting with digital technologies with no fear. I create, read, write. Keep curious and break all the food barriers (the rest follows).

## Cerise Steel

### Managing Editor
I’m a soon to be graduate of Creative Writing and Journalism from The New School. I’m from Seattle, but live in NYC. I’m a long distance and Cross Country runner. I once travelled around the world on a ship for five months. I write about what inspires me: food, running, outdoors, the places I’ve visited, and the people I’ve met.

## Carlo Mantuano

###Copy Editor and Senior Editor
I’m a writing and literature student at Eugene Lang College. By the time you read this, I’ll have graduated. I’ve loved basketball for twenty-two years and counting. When I was growing up, I always wanted to be Rasheed Wallace.
Gurnee ---> Chicago ---> New York.

## Andreas Eckhardt-Læssøe

### Senior Editor
Literature student and writer from Denmark. I write in Danish, so you’ll just have to trust me that it’s pretty good. I didn’t learn how to spell my name until I was 10, so I won’t hold it against you if you misspell it, but drop me a line if you want to talk about books, or whatever.

##Troy O’Neill

### Senior Editor and Copy Editor 
I am a freshman at Eugene Lang College, double majoring in Culture and Media Studies and Philosophy. I’m interested in speculative realism, Silicon Valley, and post-internet aesthetics. New York native. I want to get a PhD in Philosophy and publish widely.

##Katherine Parker-Magyar

### Senior Editor
I’m a graduate student of literature in Liberal Studies at The New School, a communications analyst at Aegis Media, and pursuing a career in writing. I love to travel (anywhere and everywhere), engage in heated debates about the intellectual merits of popular culture (preferably over a glass of wine), and—now that the polar vortex has mercifully subsided—run along the East River.

##Anastasia Dennis

I’m at Parsons The New School For Design. I have worked as the assistant to Jim Carrey’s personal stylist, for Donna Karan New York, and at Rent The Runway.

##Silje Kristine Andersen

### Digital Production Director and Designer
I’m a graduate student in Liberal Studies at The New School. I have a B.A. in Comparative Literature from the University of Oslo. In my M.A. I’m expanding my interest in literature and culture with courses in journalism, philosophy and media. From Oslo, Norway. Love cross-country skiing and playing soccer.

## Juliana Bechara

### Designer and Photo Editor

Until this class I was always writing instead of designing or editing. Maybe from here I'll try producing as well. Sociology brought me to grad school - Liberal Studies made me stay. I love (dogs) reading bios. And, well, dislike writing them - there's always so much left to say.

I study writing (fiction, journalism, and screenwriting) and French at The New School.  When I’m not in class, I intern at Bookforum Magazine.  You can find more of my writing online under the name C. Harper Gold.  If you like 140 character feminist critiques of society, you can follow me on Twitter.
